## Phase 1:
### üìùGoals And Objectives
  
  The followind goals and objectives provide a clear roadmap for developing Skycast into a powerful, versatile, and user-centric weather forecasting application.

  * Provide users with reliable, real-time weather data tailored to their specific location or chosen city.
  * Design an intuitive interface that caters to users of all technical skill levels, ensuring ease of use and accessibility.
  * inimize manual input by leveraging geolocation technology to auto-detect the user‚Äôs location.
  * Build a flexible framework that allows for the integration of advanced features, such as weather alerts, multi-city tracking, and predictive analytics.
  * Ensure compatibility with various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) to reach a broad audience.
  * Implement seamless integration with IPBase for geolocation data.
  * Use OpenWeatherMap to fetch real-time weather details like temperature, conditions, humidity, and wind speed.

### üîëKey Features   

1. Geolocation Integration (IPBase API)

   Skycast utilizes the IPBase API to determine a user‚Äôs geographical location based on their IP address. This feature allows the app to automatically detect the user‚Äôs city or region, ensuring that the weather forecasts are relevant and tailored to their current location. This eliminates the need for manual input, enhancing user convenience.  
2. Real-Time Weather Data (OpenWeatherMap API) 

   Skycast pulls detailed weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API, offering real-time updates. It provides essential data such as:  
   - Temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit)  
   - Weather Conditions(e.g., clear skies, rain, or snow)  
   - Humidity Levels  
   - Wind Speed  
   - Forecast Trends(optional for future enhancements)  
3. Python-Driven Design  

   The application is built using Python, which ensures flexibility, reliability, and ease of maintenance. Python‚Äôs robust ecosystem allows for the integration of external libraries like `requests` for API interactions and `tkinter` or `PyQt` for user-friendly graphical interfaces.  
4. User-Friendly Interface 

   Skycast features a clean, intuitive GUI where users can view weather updates instantly. The app auto-fetches the weather for the detected location but also allows users to search for weather information in other cities manually.  
5. Customization and Extensibility 

   Skycast is designed to be easily extensible. Developers can add features such as:  
   - Hourly or weekly forecasts  
   - Weather alerts for extreme conditions  
   - Support for multiple languages

### üìúFeatures of Skycast
* Real-Time Weather Updates:

  Instant access to current weather conditions based on the user's location or manually searched cities.
* Detailed Weather Insights:
